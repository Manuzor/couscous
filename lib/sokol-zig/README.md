Auto-generated Zig bindings for the [sokol headers](https://github.com/floooh/sokol).

For Zig version 0.8.0 (current 0.9.0 dev version should also work)

If you're on a different Zig version, check the following branches:

- zig-0.7.1
- ...(to be continued)

WIP, because not all sokol-headers have been added yet.
